# resistor_finder
Find resistor(s) combos among normalized values (E12 to E96) and several topologies.

# Purpose
It happened I had to find a resistor in my stock, of a certain value, and it was a boring task.
I wrote this code in order to find quickly the solution according to the following parameters:
- Resistors series (E12, E24, E48 and E96),
- Topologies (single resistor, two resistors in series, and two resistors in parallel).
- Precision of search

# Usage
Just compile and run the code:
- clone the repository
- make resistor_finder
- ./resistor_finder
- Enter the resistor's wanted value in Ohms
- Enter a percentage which is the precision of the search (lower the  percentage, less the results)

# Update
Please feel free to update the code. I wrote that in the rush and according to my needs, therefore it surely needs enhancements.
Any help is welcome.
